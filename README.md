# Simple Notes App

## Project Overview
The Simple Notes App is a desktop and web application that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete notes. Built with Nextron (Next.js + Electron), the app provides a seamless experience for managing notes with real-time updates. It also supports persistent data storage using Electronâ€™s `fs` module. Users can create and manage their notes in a user-friendly interface with markdown support and search functionality.

### Features:
- **Create and Edit Notes**: Add new notes and edit them with rich-text formatting.
- **Delete Notes**: Remove unwanted notes.
